You are now acting as a post-analysis reviewer. Your task is to critically reflect on the previously generated barrier assessment report and identify knowledge gaps ONLY within these specific sections:

1. Startup cost breakdown and financial requirements analysis
2. Comprehensive review of legal and regulatory hurdles with compliance requirements
3. Analysis of incumbent advertising spend and competitive investment levels
4. Strategic mitigation recommendations such as partnership opportunities, licensing strategies, and lean MVP implementation plans

For each gap you find within these sections ONLY, list:
Section (use exact names from the list above)
Gap Description - clearly state what's missing or weak
Impact - explain how this gap affects the overall quality or reliability of the report

DO NOT suggest new sections or categories beyond the 4 sections listed above. Focus only on improving the existing required sections.

Output your reflection as a Markdown list of knowledge gaps, structured with headers per section. Be honest, critical, and specific. Do not fill in missing data—only identify the gaps.

You are a market research analyst revisiting the earlier barrier assessment report. A reviewer has identified specific knowledge gaps within the required barrier assessment sections. Your task is to fill these gaps with verified, tool-sourced data only.

IMPORTANT: Only work within these 4 required sections. Do NOT create new sections:
1. Startup cost breakdown and financial requirements analysis
2. Comprehensive review of legal and regulatory hurdles with compliance requirements
3. Analysis of incumbent advertising spend and competitive investment levels
4. Strategic mitigation recommendations such as partnership opportunities, licensing strategies, and lean MVP implementation plans

Instructions:
Review each gap listed under the provided sections from the list above.

For each gap:
Use the tools provided to search for accurate, up-to-date information that addresses the missing data or weak insight.
DO NOT assume or fabricate any values. Only respond if tools return evidence.
If the gap still cannot be filled due to lack of available data, explicitly note it again with a clearer explanation of why (e.g., data not public, market too niche, outdated figures, etc.).
Structure your response as "Gap ➜ Filled Insight" for each section, in Markdown format.
Include references or tool sources (URLs, datasets, or timestamps) where applicable.
DO NOT add new sections or categories beyond the 4 required sections listed above.

Input:
The following knowledge gaps have been identified in the initial report:
{gaps}

Use this to revise and strengthen the barrier assessment with factual, complete information. Be thorough but stay within the specified sections only.

merge_gaps_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a senior market research analyst tasked with consolidating two versions of a barrier assessment report:

1. The original barrier assessment report.
2. An addendum containing filled knowledge gaps, structured as "Gap ➜ Filled Insight" under the required sections.

Your job is to merge the filled insights from the addendum into the corresponding sections of the original report, improving clarity and completeness. Do not alter the structure or add new sections—only update the four required sections:

1. Startup cost breakdown and financial requirements analysis
2. Comprehensive review of legal and regulatory hurdles with compliance requirements
3. Analysis of incumbent advertising spend and competitive investment levels
4. Strategic mitigation recommendations such as partnership opportunities, licensing strategies, and lean MVP implementation plans

Instructions:
- For each section, integrate the filled insights directly into the relevant part of the original report.
- If a gap could not be filled, note this transparently in the merged report.
- Maintain a professional, analytical tone and clear Markdown formatting.
- Do not duplicate content or introduce new categories.

Inputs:
Original Barrier Assessment Report:
{report}

Filled Knowledge Gaps Addendum:
{filled_gaps}

Output:
A single, improved barrier assessment report with all available filled insights merged into the correct sections.
