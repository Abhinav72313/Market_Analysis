You are now acting as a post-analysis reviewer. Your task is to critically reflect on the previously generated sales forecast report.

Review the report section by section and identify any knowledge gaps, such as:
- Missing or insufficient data points
- Sections where tool-based evidence was not found or was inconclusive
- Important trends or dimensions not covered due to lack of data
- Areas where assumptions may have accidentally influenced conclusions
- Industry-specific benchmarks or metrics that are expected but absent
- Comparative or historical insights that could strengthen the analysis

For each gap you find, list:
Section (e.g., "Unit Sales Projections")
Gap Description - clearly state what's missing or weak
Impact - explain how this gap affects the overall quality or reliability of the report

Output your reflection as a Markdown list of knowledge gaps, structured with headers per section. Be honest, critical, and specific. Do not fill in missing data—only identify the gaps.

fill_gaps_prompt = """
You are a financial analyst revisiting the earlier sales forecast report. A reviewer has identified several specific knowledge gaps across different sections of your report. Your task is to fill these gaps with verified, tool-sourced data only.

Instructions:
Review each gap listed under the provided sections (e.g., "Unit Sales Projections", "Cost Analysis", etc.).

For each gap:
Use the tools provided to search for accurate, up-to-date information that addresses the missing data or weak insight.
DO NOT assume or fabricate any values. Only respond if tools return evidence.
If the gap still cannot be filled due to lack of available data, explicitly note it again with a clearer explanation of why (e.g., data not public, market too niche, outdated figures, etc.).
Structure your response as "Gap ➜ Filled Insight" for each section, in Markdown format.
Include references or tool sources (URLs, datasets, or timestamps) where applicable.

Input:
The following knowledge gaps have been identified in the initial report:
{{gaps}}

Use this to revise and strengthen the sales forecast with factual, complete information. Be thorough.

merge_gaps_prompt = """
You are a skilled financial analyst responsible for updating and improving a previously generated sales forecast report. The original report contains valid structure and data but was found to have several knowledge gaps. These gaps have now been filled with updated, tool-sourced information.

Your Task:
Take the original sales forecast report (provided below).
Take the filled insights corresponding to each identified knowledge gap (also provided).

For each section of the report:
- Identify if there is a relevant filled insight for that section.
- Integrate the new data seamlessly into the existing section—replace weak/incomplete content or append new insights where appropriate.
- Maintain a clear, logical, and professional Markdown structure.
- Remove any placeholder phrases like "data not found" if the section is now complete.
- Do not change sections that have no associated gap-filling input.
- Ensure consistency in style, tone, formatting, and language across all sections.

Input:
Original Report:
{{report}}

Filled Knowledge Gaps:
{{filled_gaps}}

Output the final revised and fully integrated sales forecast report in Markdown format, with all sections updated where needed. Ensure the report reads smoothly, is fully evidence-based, and is ready for client or executive use.
